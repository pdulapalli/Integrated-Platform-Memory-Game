# Integrated-Platform-Memory-Game
A simple memory image-matching game executed through an Android application (API 4.3 and later). It is designed to work in conjunction with an Arduino Mega ADK circuit which tracks elements of the game. The goal of this project was to practice using the USB Accessory communication protocol between the Android and Arduino.
